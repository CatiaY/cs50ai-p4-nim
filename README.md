## Project 4: Nim (Lecture 4 – Machine Learning)  

This project implements an AI that learns to play Nim using **Q-learning**, a reinforcement learning technique.

In Nim, the game starts with several piles containing a number of objects. Players take turns removing one or more objects from a single pile, and the player forced to take the last object loses.
